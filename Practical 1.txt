1. Create a database having two tables with the specified fields, to computerize a library system of a Delhi University College. 
LibraryBooks (Accession number, Title, Author, Department, PurchaseDate, Price) 10 

IssuedBooks (Accession number, Borrower) 
a) Identify primary and foreign keys. Create the tables and insert at least 5 records in each table. 
b) Delete the record of book titled “Database System Concepts”. 
c) Change the Department of the book titled “Discrete Maths” to “CS”. 
d) List all books that belong to “CS” department. 
e) List all books that belong to “CS” department and are written by author “Navathe”. 
f) List all computer (Department = “CS”) that have been issued. 
g) List all books which have a price less than 500 or purchased between “01/01/1999” and “01/01/2004”. 

Solution:
create database db;
use db;

-----Creating Tables-----

create table LibraryBooks(
Accession_number int(10) primary key,
Title varchar(40) not null,
Author varchar(20) not null,
Department varchar(15) not null,
PurchaseDate date,
Price int(10));

create table IssuedBooks(
Accession_number int(10) not null,
Borrower varchar(30),
foreign key(Accession_number) references LibraryBooks(Accession_number));

(a)
Accession_number is the primary key for table LibraryBooks and it is the foreign key for table Issued books.

-----Inserting values-----

insert into LibraryBooks(1234,"Database System Concepts","Ranjit Prasad","CS",'2015-02-26',450);
insert into LibraryBooks(5468,"Discrete Maths","RD Sharma",Mathematics",'2005-03-28',880);
insert into LibraryBooks(9876,"Trigonometry","SL Loney","Mathematics",'2010-12-08',490)

insert into IssuedBooks values(1234,”Anupam Anand”);
insert into IssuedBooks values(1556,”V K Singh”);
insert into IssuedBooks values(8856,”Aviral Yadav”);
insert into IssuedBooks values(5598,”Arpit Maurya”);
insert into IssuedBooks values(1897,”Shubham Kumar Gupta”);

(b) 
delete from libraryBooks
where Title="Database System Concepts"; 

(c)
update Librarybooks
set Depatment="CS"
where Title="Discrete Maths";

(d)
select * from librarybooks
where Department="CS";

(e)
select * from librarybooks
where Department="CS" and Author="Navathe";

(f)
select * from LibraryBooks a Lb,IssuedBooks as Ib
where Lb.Department="CS" and Lb.Accession_number=Ib.Accession_number;

(g)
select * from Librarybooks 
where price < 500 and purchasedate between '1999-01-01' and '2004-01-01';
